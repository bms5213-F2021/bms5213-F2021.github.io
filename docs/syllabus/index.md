## Description, Goals, & Objectives
<a name="Description"></a>
**Course Description** <br />
This (virtual) course is an introduction to the concepts & methods of biostatistical data analysis in research settings. The topics which will be covered include descriptive statistics, sampling distributions, point & confidence interval estimation, hypothesis testing, & linear regression. The course provides hands-on training with R to prepare students for real-life data analysis. As such, students will analyze, compare, perform, and evaluate data analyses of real-life, published data.

<a name="Studymats"></a>
**Study Materials** <br />
This course does not have a required text. The course "textbook"/reading material will be assembled by the instructor from multiple sources and posted to the course material website each week. Any lecture notes or slides will also be made available on Canvas or through the course website. Recordings of interactive lectures will be posted to Canvas.

<a name="Prereqs"></a>
**Prerequisites** <br />
An undergraduate-level understanding of probability, biology, and biological research are assumed.

<a name="Goals"></a>
**Goals** <br />
This course is primarily designed for masters students who will need to apply principles from this course to their capstone research projects. Therefore, the goal of this course is to faciliate the comfort, competency, and confidence of the student to evaluate, perform, and communicate sound, reproducible biostatistical data analysis.

<a name="Objectives"></a>
**Objectives** <br />
* Define the types of data analytic questions and classify examples in biology research.
* Describe the steps of a data analysis project.
* Practice reproducibility & thorough documentation in analysis projects.
* Recognize biases present in data due to sampling procedure or analysis.
* Distinguish between different types of data students will encounter in biology research and classify examples in the correct group.
* Define and calculate descriptive statistics for central tendency and variability or dispersion. Interpret how these values are communicated in plots.
* Compare and contrast the utility of different types of plots for summarizing data clearly and accurately.
* Compare and contrast discrete and continuous distributions.
* Describe the characteristics of and graphical appearance of probability distributions.
* Determine what probability distribution satisfies the necessary requirements given information and assumptions about data/processes.
* Use sample data to find actual results and use probabilities to find expected results.
* Describe the relation between population-based and sample-based information.
* Use estimation to infer or estimate the value of a population parameter given sample data.
* Differentiate between unbiased and biased estimators.
* Construct confidence intervals for estimated parameters.
* Describe the difference between the non-parametric and parametric bootstrap. Apply the bootstrap in confidence interval estimation and to compare two data sets.
* Determine minimum sample sizes necessary for estimation.
* Develop the ability to identify the null and alternative hypotheses when given some claim about a population.
* Use sample data to test hypotheses or claims made about population parameters and state the conclusion in both technical terms (of rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis) and simple terms.
* Use hypothesis testing to test whether real and expected results differ significantly.
* Employ multiple hypothesis testing correction when appropriate.
* Accurately define, use, and compare p-values.
* Compute and describe the correlation between data sets.
* Discuss the differences between correlation and causation.
* Use regression to find the best equation describing a set of data.
* Using regression, predict outcomes given new data.
* Describe and identify when it is appropriate to use Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). What questions can be answered with ANOVA. Apply ANOVA and make accurate conclusions.
* Describe the differences between parametric and non-parametric tests. Identify when it is appropriate to use each.
* Identify advantages and disadvantages of non-parametric tests.
* Convert data into ranks and apply non-parametric tests on data.
* Describe why survival data requires its own type of analysis.
* Construct and interpret Kaplan-Meier curves for survival analysis.
* Analyze, evaluate, perform, & communicate real-life data analyses.

<a name="Grading"></a>
<br />**Grading**<br />
*Philosophy:* <br />
Because the overarching goal of this course is to aid your training in performing and evaluating your own data analyses, there is lesser value assigned to the book-knowledge part of this course. However, these book-knowledge basics are fundamental to a student's success in the performing and evaluating of data analyses. Therefore, there will be low-stakes quizzes, homework, a take-home midterm, and a take-home final to assess these basics; but the most weight will be placed on the hands-on projects & presentations. <br />

<br />*Relative Weights:* <br />
* Homework 16% (=4 * 4%)
* Quizzes 10% (=(12-2) * 1%)
* Midterm 8%
* Final 8%
* Projects 60% (=4 * 15%)

<br />**Note:** This course will be graded out of 100 while 16 + 10 + 8 + 8 + 60 = 102. <br />

## Attendance, Academic Integrity, Code of Conduct, & Accommodations

<a name="Attendance"></a>
**Attendance Policy** <br />
Most course sessions will include some optional in-class work time, but will also include interactive lectures, low-stakes quizzes, or project presentations. Therefore regular attendance is essential, expected, and highly recommended, but not required as attendance will not be graded. Further, interactive course sessions will be recorded and made available. Please contact the course instructor if you will not be able to attend a class session. The instructor will work to accommodate reasonable requests for emergencies, family responsibilities, illness, etc. that may prevent attendance.

<a name="Integrity"></a>
**Academic Integrity & Ethics** <br />
Academic and scientific institutions and research depend on honesty and integrity. You should be completing your homework, projects, and exams without plagiarizing others -- including any group partners, presenters, and strangers posting to online forums or blogs. For any group work, you and your partner(s) should be working together, but all persons should be writing and turning in unique, individualized code and projects. Note, specifically for code and statistical analyses, your scripts may follow the same logic steps and even have tidbits of the same code, but no one person should be writing the solution the whole group uses character for character. Additionally, you should understand every line of code you write, are given to use, or find online and incorporate. If asked to, you should be able to explain exactly what your code is doing. Another aspect is properly acknowledging the source of borrowed code. Understanding can be cultivated and acknowledgement implemented by writing comments in your code. Further, don't give someone code to copy and paste. Make sure any recipient can explain back to you any gifted code. See the [university's guidelines](https://www.lipscomb.edu/academics/academic-support/academic-integrity) on plagiarism for details and contact the instructor with any questions.

<a name="codeofconduct"></a>
**Code of Conduct** <br />
This course is committed to creating a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free environment for everyone. Harassment in any form through any mode of interaction and communication will not be tolerated. <br />
All class participants agree to:
* **Be considerate and polite**. This course will likely be stressful and possibly frustrating from time to time. In addition, the collaborative nature of the course means it is essential that students are respectful of each other's questions and points of confusion. Remember that everyone is joining this course with a wide range of coding or mathematical backgrounds, but a student's only concern should be with improving their own skills. A community where people feel uncomfortable is not conducive for learning.
* **Work together cooperatively**. Be kind when giving feedback to classmates and make an effort to help if you can. You will gain much more from explaining concepts to someone else than you will from rushing through the course and assignments on your own.
* **Refrain from demaining, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech**. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography or recording; sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes, and unwelcome sexual attention. If you feel that someone has harassed you or otherwise treated you inappropriately, please alert the instructor or a department administrator.
* **Refrain from advocating for, or encouraging, negative behavior**. And if someone asks you to stop, then stop. Alert the instructor if you notice a dangerous situations, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, no matter how inconsequential it seems.
* Please see the [university's code of conduct](https://www.lipscomb.edu/student-life/student-expectations) for more information.
