# Week 2 -- Part 1

## Week 2 Learning Objectives

By the end of Weeks 2 & 3, you will be able to

* Compare and contrast discrete and continuous distributions
* Describe the characteristics of and graphical appearance of probability distributions important for biology.
* Determine what probability distribution satisfies the necessary requirements given information and assumptions about data/processes.
* Use sample data to find actual results and use probabilities to find expected results.
* Describe the relation between population-based and sample-based information.
* Use estimation to infer or estimate the value of a population parameter given sample data.
* Differentiate between unbiased and biased estimators.
* Construct confidence intervals for estimated parameters.
* Describe the difference between the non-parametric and parametric bootstrap. Apply the bootstrap in confidence interval estimation and to compare two data sets.
* Determine minimum sample sizes necessary for estimation.
* Develop the ability to identify the null and alternative hypotheses when given some claim about a population
* Use sample data to test hypotheses or claims made about population parameters and state the conclusions in both technical terms (of rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis) and simple terms.
* Use hypothesis testing to test whether real and expected results differ significantly.
* Employ multiple hypothesis testing correction when appropriate.
* Accurately define, use, and compare p-values.
