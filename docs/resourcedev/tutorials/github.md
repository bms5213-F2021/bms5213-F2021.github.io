## GitHub

### Homework and Project Base Repos

The base repos for homework and project assignments are meant to be generic examples to show everyone what the assignment is and assignment instructions are. But these base repositories are not for turning in a student's work.
The pattern url for each of these is `https://github.com/bms5213-F2021/[assignmentName]` where you fill in the `[assignmentName]` with whatever it is. For example, for `hw1` (or homework 1), the url is `https://github.com/bms5213-F2021/hw1/`.

### Homework and Project Individual Repos

Each student is given an individual repo meant for turning in the assignment. The pattern url for each of these is `https://github.com/bms5213-F2021/[assignmentName]-ind-[yourgithubusername]`, where the student fills in the `[assignmentName]` and their GitHub username in place of`[yourgithubusername]`.

### View every repo you have access to

A student can view every repo they have access to within the course by using the following link. As long as the student is logged in to GitHub, the link will list repositories the student has access to either because the repo is public (homework and project base repos) or because the student was given access to a private repo (homework and project individual repos): [https://github.com/orgs/bms5213-F2021/repositories](https://github.com/orgs/bms5213-F2021/repositories)

### How to upload to your repo

To upload a file or files to your repository, click on the "Add  file" dropdown button near the top of the page. Within the dropdown menu, click "Upload files".

![add button]("images/github_add.png")

This will open a page which allows you to drag the file(s) you want to upload or to "choose your files" using a file explorer

![choose file]("images/github_choose.png")

After you have dragged or chosen the files you want, below this and the "Commit changes" header add a helpful commit message that very briefly describes the files that you are adding. Make sure to keep the option "Commit directly to the `main` branch." checked, and then click the green "Commit changes" button.

![commit message]("images/github_commit.png")

You can at any point cancel the upload by hitting the red "Cancel" button next to the "Commit changes" button.

### How to edit files already in your repo

To edit a file that is already existing in your repo (like if you want to directly edit the `README.md` that the instructor posted), click on the file of interest in the list of files. This will open a page with specifically that file, where you can view, but can't yet edit the file.

![click on file]("images/github_click_foi.png")

To make edits to the file, click on the pencil/"Edit this file" icon in the top right corner of the file preview.

![click on pencil]("images/github_pencil.png")

This changes the view of the file such that you can now make edits to it directly.

![editing the file]("images/github_editing.png")

Again, at the bottom of this panel, there will be the "Commit changes" header where you can add a helpful commit message that very briefly describes the files that you are adding. Make sure to keep the option "Commit directly to the `main` branch." checked, and then click the green "Commit changes" button.

![commit message edit]("images/github_commit_by_edit.png")

You can at any point cancel the edits by hitting the red "Cancel" button next to the "Commit changes" button or by clicking the "Cancel changes" button at the top of the page.
